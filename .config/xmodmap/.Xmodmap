! NOTE:
! I assumed this file will be load by ~/.xinitrc

! NOTE:
!  - Comment out coz /etc/default/keyboard is better to disable capslock
!  - and  etxkbmap is modern according to the site below
!  - ref https://askubuntu.com/questions/29603/how-do-i-clear-xmodmap-settings
! remove Lock = Caps_Lock
! keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
! add Control = Control_L

! For HHKB
! remove mod4 = Super_R
! keycode 134 = Print

! because of bug of RALT
! see manual
remove mod5 = ISO_Level3_Shift
keycode 108 = Alt_R
